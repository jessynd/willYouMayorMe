#Will You Mayor Me? 

## Summary

This website/app is presently in development. It is an open source project. Everyone's input and suggestions are welcome. Somewhat of an exercise in democracy, *Will You Mayor Me?* is a website that matches candidates for Mayor of Toronto(to start with) with voters. Voters and candidates will be able to answer a series of questions based on statistically significant survey research created by political scientists. Questions will be ranked based on two overarching criteria:

1. A person's every-day needs as citizens of this city.  
2. A person's vision for the kind of city they want to live in. 

The aim is to explore the dichotomy between the selfish needs of the individual as a citizen in any given circumstance, and the vision those individuals may have for society as a whole, selfish needs aside. 

The questionnaire will be based on serious survey research but it will be presented in a fun and fresh way that people can relate to and enjoy interacting with. 

## Get Involved! 

Presently *Will You Mayor Me?* is in the early stages of conceptualization. We need help:

**Goal**: Launch a prototype by the October 2014 Toronto Election.
